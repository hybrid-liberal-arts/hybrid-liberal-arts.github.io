Welcome to the Hybrid Liberal Arts Network site!

Here you will find information about the exciting hybrid learning project of the Midwest Hybrid Learning Consortium, a collaboration of Ablion College, DePauw University, Grinnell College, Hope College, Lawrence University, and Wabash College.

We have joined together in order to develop hybrid and online materials to expand liberal arts opportunities for our students. Working together we are expanding the kinds of courses we can make available to our students, and the range of excellent teacher-scholars they might have access to.

On this site you will find resources related to hybrid and online liberal arts learning, course project descriptions and resources, and grant related documents.
