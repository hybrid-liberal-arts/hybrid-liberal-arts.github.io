The conference generated good conversation and discussion around the Teagle project of creating hybrid courses at the Midwest Hybrid Learning Consortium schools (Albion, DePauw, Grinnell, Hope, Lawrence, and Wabash). The first cohort of faculty pairs and their courses was identified.

* Elizabeth Trembley (Hope) and Deborah Seltzer-Kelly (Wabash) will hybridize writing and peer-review components of their English creative writing and Education courses respectively.
* Henning Schneider (DePauw) and Ken Saville (Albion) will create molecular biology hybrid modules.
* Martyn Smith (Lawrence) and Barry Bandstra (Hope) will create hybrid text analysis modules of the Quran and Hebrew Bible for use in their religion courses.
