---

A well-designed hybrid course typically . . .

- Places emphasis on learning as an active process, not as passive absorption of information
- Focuses on learners and learning, rather than purely content delivery and testing for information acquisition
- Includes online interaction among students and between instructor and students
- Includes significant instructor presence online throughout the course
- Uses less than half of class time for one-way delivery of information by the instructor via lecture
- Devotes significant classroom time to multi-path interaction between students and instructor
- Engages students in learning activities both online and in the classroom
- Explicitly integrates online content and activities with in-class content and activities
- Uses frequent low-stakes assessments of student learning at regular intervals with timely feedback
- Uses rubrics on assignments where appropriate for guidance and for structured feedback
- Makes possible a degree of student choice over pathways to reach learning outcomes
- Aligns content, resources, activities and assessment with learning outcomes
- Actively encourages learning and interaction beyond the physical classroom
