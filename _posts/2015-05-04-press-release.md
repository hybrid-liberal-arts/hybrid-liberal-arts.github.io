The Teagle Foundation of New York awarded a grant to a consortium of
midwestern liberal arts colleges to collaborate on the development of
hybrid courses and share them across institutions. The project, entitled
"Hybrid Liberal Arts Network: Hybrid Learning for the 21st Century,"
joins Albion College, DePauw University, Grinnell College, Lawrence
University, Hope College, and Wabash College in the effort to pioneerÂ a
hybrid liberal arts network of institutions that would share hybrid
modules and courses. [Hope College press
