BRIEF 5-minute report out by teams (record by video for sharing?)

 - Looking ahead to creating a hybrid liberal arts network for sharing the hybrid/online material and courses that we create:
	- What structures do faculty members at our schools need to have in place in order to share and receive credit for hybrid projects and courses?
	- How do we continue communicating across institutions, be it on an individual team level or sharing common best practices/worst practices, as we work throughout the year?
	- What needs do teams have for project management assistance?  How can the consortium contribute and help?
	- How might we incentivize participating institutions to share unique expertise of instructional technologists for a project on another campus without adding to their workload?
