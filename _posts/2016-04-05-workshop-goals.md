---
This is what we expect to accomplish over the course of the workshop, so that by the end of the workshop, we've accomplished 

##Learning goals
- What are the learning goals for the students in each course module?
- What are the goals for creating blended learning?

##Project management
- How will you document the process of the project? How will you keep track of the project?
- What deadlines are relevant to the project? (promotion of courses on campus, registrar’s catalog, student registration, etc.)
- Who will do what and by when?

##Support
- What help will be needed from instructional technologists, librarians, teaching assistants?
- What equipment, hardware, and software will be needed? How will it be acquired?

##Media and hosting
- What media will be used in developing course materials?
- What design elements are important in creating the content for learning?
- Where will the modules be hosted (platform and location)?

##Assessment
- What are the assessment mechanisms for ...
	- Formative - so that members can make needed adjustments mid-semester/mid-creation of modules
	- Summative - assessment to answer the question “Why use blended learning?”
	- Summative - broader goals (NSSE questions adapted)

##Accessibility
- What specific steps are included in creating ADA/508c compliant materials (will depend on media used)
- Universal design, designing for re-usability

##Sustainability
- What is needed to maintain the project long-term (e.g., storage, maintaining user interface)? Who will help maintain it? 
- What are the tasks for faculty vs. support staff (e.g., updating materials/format as software/platforms are upgraded, periodic useability testing)?

##Dissemination
- How will materials be available to other schools in the network for use?
- How will lessons learned and best/worst practices be disseminated in the network?
And beyond the network?

##Final documentation
- What will be the final product of the project--article, blog post, video, syllabi, etc.?
